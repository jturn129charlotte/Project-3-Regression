    "For this project, I used the Kaggle House Prices dataset to predict the sale price of houses based on various property features. The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the price of a home given characteristics like overall quality, living area, and year built. Regression is appropriate because the target variable (SalePrice) is continuous. Predicting house prices can help identify which property features have the biggest impact on value and improve decision-making in real estate.\n"

    "The Linear Regression model performed well on the house price dataset, achieving an R² score of 0.84. This means the model can explain around 84% of the variability in house prices based on the features provided. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of about 21,687 indicates that, on average, the model’s predictions are off by roughly $21,000. While this is a good start, there is room to improve accuracy by testing additional models or performing feature engineering."
